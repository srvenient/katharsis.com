- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **API Specification**: OpenAPI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend development and client generation)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for backend development and utility scripts)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**

    This project uses a `.env` file for environment variable configuration. You can start by copying the template or by using the `copier.yml` to guide you.
    Refer to `copier.yml` for a list of available variables and their descriptions. At a minimum, you'll likely need to configure database credentials and secret keys.

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the necessary values.

3.  **Build and run the application:**

    This command will build the Docker images (if they don't exist) and start all the services defined in `docker-compose.yml` (backend, frontend, database).

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    - The backend API will typically be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
    - The frontend application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Generate frontend client (if needed):**

    If you make changes to the backend API, you'll need to regenerate the frontend client:

    ```bash
    sh ./scripts/generate-client.sh
    ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

└── README.md           # This file
```

## API Documentation

The backend API is built with FastAPI, which automatically generates interactive API documentation using OpenAPI.

Once the backend service is running (via `docker-compose up`), you can access the API documentation at:

- **Swagger UI**: [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **ReDoc**: [`http://localhost:8000/redoc`](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

The OpenAPI schema can be found at `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`.

The frontend client is generated from this OpenAPI schema using the `scripts/generate-client.sh` script. If you make changes to the API, remember to run this script to update the client.

## Deployment

The project includes scripts to facilitate deployment using Docker.

-   **`scripts/build.sh`**: Builds the Docker images for the frontend and backend.
-   **`scripts/build-push.sh`**: Builds and pushes the Docker images to a container registry (requires TAG environment variable).
-   **`scripts/deploy.sh`**: Deploys the application using Docker Stack (requires DOMAIN, STACK_NAME, and TAG environment variables).

Before deploying, ensure you have configured your environment variables appropriately for your target environment (staging, production, etc.). The `deploy.sh` script uses `docker-compose.yml` as a base and generates a `docker-stack.yml` file for deployment.

You will need a Docker Swarm environment to deploy using Docker Stack. Consult the [Docker Swarm documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) for more details.

**Note**: Further customization of the deployment scripts and Docker configurations might be necessary depending on your specific infrastructure and deployment strategy.
